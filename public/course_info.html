<h2 class="h2-custom">Overview</h2>
This course focuses on emerging AI-powered computer graphics techniques that have enabled the many exciting groundbreaking applications across computer graphics, 3D vision, and generative AI. We will begin with the mathematical foundations and historical context of traditional computer graphics, providing a comprehensive overview of the evolution of these modern techniques throughout the history of graphics. The core topics include neural implicit functions (e.g., SDFs), neural radiance fields (NeRFs), Gaussian splatting, generative graphics, and differentiable physics.

<h2 class="h2-custom">Instructor</h2>
<a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~bozhu/" class="link-inline">Bo Zhu</a>, Assistant Professor, School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology

<h2 class="h2-custom">TAs</h2>
<p>Duowen Chen (Head TA), Molin Deng (Ed Discussion TA), Amrutha Srikanth, Mengdi Wang, Sinan Wang</p>

<h2 class="h2-custom">Late-Day Policy</h2>
<p>Every student is allotted seven late days for assignments. However, these late days are not applicable to the final project or quizzes. You are free to use these late days at any point during the quarter to accommodate your schedule. To utilize a late day, please specify this in the comment section of your assignment submission so our TAs are informed. Should you wish to waive a late day or require an extension beyond these seven days, please seek permission from Bo.</p>
<p>If your assignment is submitted at times such as 12:04 am or 12:20 am, Canvas may categorize it as a late submission. However, we do not classify this as a late submission. If the assignment is submitted within a reasonable time frame, it will not activate a late day. We always intend not to rush toward deadlines but to focus on creating more perfect graphics.</p>

<h2 class="h2-custom">Starter Code</h2>
<p>We maintain our starter code on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/cg-gatech/cgai" class="link-inline">https://github.com/cg-gatech/cgai</a></p>
<p>You can find tutorial videos for how to set up the starter code in the <code class="code-inline">assignments/project_setup</code> folder in the Canvas Files.</p>

<h2 class="h2-custom">Vercel Demo</h2>
<p>All the tutorials, assignment defaults, and relevant ShaderToy resources are interactively demonstrated on the following Vercel app: <a href="https://cgai-gatech.vercel.app/" class="link-inline">https://cgai-gatech.vercel.app/</a></p>

<h2 class="h2-custom">Readings</h2>
<p>There is no textbook for this class. Reading materials are maintained as a list on the CGAI website.</p>

<h2 class="h2-custom">Discussion</h2>
<p>We will use Ed Discussion for our class discussion and work sharing. Access Ed Discussion via our Canvas main page.</p>

<h2 class="h2-custom">Prerequisite</h2>
<p>CS3451 or equivalence.</p>

<h2 class="h2-custom">Assignments and Projects</h2>
<p>This course includes four programming assignments (some of which are divided into Parts A and B to cover the graphics and AI components), one midterm exam, and one final project.</p>
